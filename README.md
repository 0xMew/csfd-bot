# Breaking ČSFD

**Disclaimer: This project is no longer maintained. It was created purely for educational and experimental purposes.**

## Overview

**Breaking ČSFD** was an experimental automation tool designed to create user accounts on [ČSFD.cz](https://www.csfd.cz), a popular Czech movie database site.

The project successfully automated the account creation process. However, due to the absence of essential security features like proxy rotation or the use of custom email addresses, the created accounts were quickly detected and banned.

## Current Status

This project is no longer actively maintained. Some of its components depend on third-party services that may no longer be functional or available.

## Usage Notes

To use this tool effectively (if reviving or adapting it for personal experimentation), the following are **strongly recommended**:

- Implement a **proxy management system** to obfuscate the origin of requests.
- Use **custom or disposable email services** to avoid detection.

With these precautions in place, the tool can generate an unlimited number of undetectable accounts.
